## üì± Android Automation Utilities

This repository contains a collection of scripts and tools to **automate Android device interactions** using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). These utilities are helpful for:

* UI testing and validation
* App navigation and prototyping
* Building AI agents that simulate human interaction on Android devices
* Generating annotated views of app UIs for programmatic interaction
* Extracting APK information and metadata

### üîß Available Scripts

#### 1. **ADB Controller Script (`adb_controller.py`)**

üìÇ [`adb_controller.py`](./adb_controller.py)

This core script provides a Python interface to send basic ADB commands for emulating touchscreen interactions and key presses on a connected Android device. It includes functions to:

* Retrieve device screen resolution.
* Tap, long-tap, and swipe across the screen (custom coordinates and duration).
* Perform directional swipes (up, down, left, right).
* Type text directly into focused input fields.
* Send common key events like Home, Back, Enter, Power, Volume controls, Media controls, Delete, Tab, and App Switch.

‚úÖ Robust error handling is included for common issues like device connection problems, screen resolution parsing failures, and ADB command execution errors.

üß™ **Example Use Cases**:

* Automate login flows
* Scroll through apps for testing
* Simulate touch interactions for mobile AI agents

#### 2. **Interactive ADB Controller (`interactive_adb.py`)**

üìÇ [`interactive_adb.py`](./interactive_adb.py)

This script offers an interactive command-line menu to utilize the functionalities of `adb_controller.py`. It allows users to:

* Choose from a list of actions (e.g., tap, type, swipe, press specific keys).
* Input necessary parameters like coordinates or text when prompted.
* See immediate feedback as actions are performed on the device.

This is useful for manually testing ADB commands or exploring app interactions without writing a full script.

#### 3. **Annotated Screenshot Generator (`annotated_screenshot_generator.py`)**

üìÇ [`annotated_screenshot_generator.py`](./annotated_screenshot_generator.py)

This script captures the current screen and its UI layout (XML hierarchy) from the Android device. It then:

* Parses the XML to identify specified UI elements (e.g., all "clickable" elements).
* Assigns unique IDs to these elements (using logic similar to some UI automation agents).
* Draws bounding boxes and numerical labels on the captured screenshot around the identified elements.
* Saves the annotated screenshot to an output directory.

This utility is crucial for developing systems that need to visually understand and interact with specific UI components, forming a basis for more advanced UI automation and AI agents.

#### 4. **Example Automation Script (`my_automation.py`)**

üìÇ [`my_automation.py`](./my_automation.py)

This script serves as a practical example demonstrating how to use the `adb_controller.py` module to create a simple automation workflow. It illustrates:

* Importing and using functions from `adb_controller.py`.
* Sequencing actions like tapping, typing, and swiping with appropriate delays.
* A basic example of navigating an app (e.g., opening search, typing, and swiping).

Users can adapt this script as a template for their own custom automation tasks.

#### 5. **APK Information Extractor (`apk_info.py`)**

üìÇ [`apk_info.py`](./apk_info.py)

This script extracts key information from Android APK files using the Android Asset Packaging Tool (aapt). It provides:

* Package name extraction
* App name extraction
* Clean formatting of extracted information
* Automatic aapt tool detection in common Android SDK locations

üß™ **Example Use Case**:
```bash
python apk_info.py path/to/your.apk
```
Output:

#### 6. **APK Info Getter (`get_apk_info.py`)**

üìÇ [`get_apk_info.py`](./get_apk_info.py)

A simplified wrapper script for `apk_info.py` that provides quick access to APK information extraction functionality. Useful for quick command-line usage or integration into other scripts.

### üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
    * Ensure ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is installed on your system and added to your system's PATH.
    * Connect your Android device via USB or ensure it's connected via Wi-Fi ADB.
    * Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on your Android device.
    * Authorize the ADB connection on your device when prompted.
    * Install Android SDK for APK information extraction features.

2. **Verify Device Connection**:
    Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    adb devices
    ```
    You should see your device listed.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install pyshine opencv-python
    ```

4. **Running the Scripts**:

    * **ADB Controller (`adb_controller.py`)**: This script is primarily a module to be imported by other scripts.

    * **Interactive ADB Controller (`interactive_adb.py`)**:
        ```bash
        python interactive_adb.py
        ```
        Then follow the on-screen menu.

    * **Annotated Screenshot Generator (`annotated_screenshot_generator.py`)**:
        ```bash
        python annotated_screenshot_generator.py
        ```
        Check the `output_annotated` directory for the result.

    * **Example Automation (`my_automation.py`)**:
        ```bash
        python my_automation.py
        ```
        Observe your connected device to see the automation steps.

    * **APK Information Extractor (`apk_info.py`)**:
        ```bash
        python apk_info.py path/to/your.apk
        ```
        Get package name and app name from an APK file.

    * **APK Info Getter (`get_apk_info.py`)**:
        ```bash
        python get_apk_info.py path/to/your.apk
        ```
        Quick access to APK information.

### üìù Notes

* The `adb_controller.py` script is a library of functions. To see it in action, you would typically run `interactive_adb.py` or `my_automation.py` which import and use its functions.
* For APK information extraction, make sure you have Android SDK installed with build-tools.
* All scripts include error handling and user feedback for better usability.
